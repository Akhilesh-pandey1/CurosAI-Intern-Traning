Create specification files that define WHAT the system should do.

A spec is a behavior contract, not an implementation plan.

Good spec content:
- Observable behavior users or downstream systems rely on
- Inputs, outputs, and error conditions
- External constraints (security, privacy, reliability, compatibility)
- Scenarios that can be tested or explicitly validated

Avoid in specs:
- Internal class/function names
- Library or framework choices
- Step-by-step implementation details
- Detailed execution plans (those belong in design.md or tasks.md)

Quick test: if the implementation can change without changing externally
visible behavior, it likely does not belong in the spec.

Create one spec file per capability listed in the proposal's Capabilities section,
at `agent-doc/specs/<feature>.md` (kebab-case name, e.g. `task-workflow.md`).
Use the exact name from the proposal.

Format requirements:
- Each requirement: `### Requirement: <name>` followed by description
- Use SHALL/MUST for normative requirements (avoid should/may)
- Each scenario: `#### Scenario: <name>` with WHEN/THEN format
- **CRITICAL**: Scenarios MUST use exactly 4 hashtags (`####`). Using 3 hashtags or bullets will fail silently.
- Every requirement MUST have at least one scenario.

Start each spec with a `## Purpose` section - one or two sentences (50+ characters)
describing what the capability is for. Follow it with `## Requirements` containing
the requirement blocks.

Example:
```
## Purpose

Lets users take their data out of the product in a portable format.

## Requirements

### Requirement: User can export data
The system SHALL allow users to export their data in CSV format.

#### Scenario: Successful export
- **WHEN** user clicks "Export" button
- **THEN** system downloads a CSV file with all user data
```

Specs should be testable - each scenario is a potential test case.
