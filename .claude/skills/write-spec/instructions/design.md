Create the design document that explains HOW to implement the change.

Scale design.md to the change (a short one is fine when none of these apply):
- Cross-cutting change (multiple services/modules) or new architectural pattern
- New external dependency or significant data model changes
- Security, performance, or migration complexity
- Ambiguity that benefits from technical decisions before coding

Sections:
- **Context**: Only the current state and constraints needed to explain the approach. Reference the proposal for motivation instead of restating it (e.g., "See proposal.md - Why").
- **Goals / Non-Goals**: What this design achieves and explicitly excludes. Don't restate the proposal's scope - add only design-level boundaries.
- **Decisions**: Key technical choices with rationale (why X over Y?). Include alternatives considered for each decision.
- **Risks / Trade-offs**: Known limitations, things that could go wrong. Format: [Risk] → Mitigation
- **Migration Plan**: Steps to deploy, rollback strategy (if applicable)
- **Open Questions**: Unknowns that can safely be answered later without
changing the specs, the approach, or the task breakdown. Omit if none.

Open questions are for genuinely deferrable unknowns, not decisions you
skipped. If a question would change the specs, the chosen approach, or
the task breakdown, resolve it now - ask the user instead of guessing.

Focus on architecture and approach, not line-by-line implementation.
The proposal covers why and what; design covers how. Reference the
proposal for motivation and, once written, the specs for requirements -
if a section would only restate them, point to them instead.

Good design docs explain the "why" behind technical decisions.
